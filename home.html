		<h2>Magic! The Gathering</h2>
			<p>Primarily an Commander player, I play a lot of heads-up with my partner or do some 40-card drafting.  
			On casual nights, you can sometimes find us out at Odyssey for some multiplayer (though we are always up for a kitchen table game).  
			My primary deck is <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=433279">Inalla, archmage ritualist</a> (blue, black, red, wizards-tribal reanimation) though if you're up for some meme-Brawl, I have a <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=452942">Niv-Mizzut Parun</a> deck called Dominizzit that is hilariously fun to play.
			I keep trying to get into Arena, especially  given the pandemic, but my print collection is too extensive to abandon easily...  If you're ever looking for a game, check out my <a href="about.html">about me</a> section to send me an email!</p>

		<h2>Board Sports</h2>
		<img src="C:\Users\jicro\Pictures\lightning\wakeboarding.jpg" />
			<p>Snowboarding and wakeboarding are my foremost boardsport loves, though lately Kiteboarding has been a growing passion.
			Bittersweet, Timber Ridge and Crystal Mountain are my typical winter "local" spots, though Whistler-Blackcomb in Vancouver forever has my heart.
			In the summer, Holland has some nice spots for wakeboarding, surfing and kiteboarding, though nothing will beat the Outer Banks, NC.</p>
			
		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>Epic sci-fi and fantasy all the way.
		A few all-time favorite authors include: Patrick Rothfuss, Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
		I am <b><i>always</i></b> looking for something new to read. <a href="mailto:jaymeipema@gmail.com">(send me a recommendation)</a></p>
